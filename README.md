# Playwright MCP Proof of Concept (PoC)

## 1. Objective

The purpose of this Proof of Concept (PoC) is to evaluate the feasibility of integrating **Playwright MCP** into our test automation framework. Specifically, this PoC aims to:

- Demonstrate how Playwright MCP can interact with our existing system under test.
- Assess the benefits of MCP integration in terms of scalability, maintainability, and developer productivity.
- Identify potential challenges, limitations, and risks before full-scale adoption.

## 2. Background

**Playwright** is a modern end-to-end testing framework supporting multiple browsers (Chromium, Firefox, WebKit).  

**MCP (Model Context Protocol)** is a protocol that allows Playwright (and other tools) to interact with external services or models, such as AI-driven assistance, API layers, or context providers.  

By leveraging Playwright MCP, we can potentially extend automation capabilities, including:

- Smart element handling with AI assistance.
- Automatic code generation based on tester-provided test steps.
- Support for the Page Object Model (POM) for separation of locators and test logic.
- Extra helper functions and automation layers for faster, maintainable test creation.
- Support for data-driven testing.

## 3. Proposed Approach

### Environment Setup

1. Install Playwright with MCP support.
2. Configure the test environment (Node.js, TypeScript/JavaScript).
3. Connect MCP to an external service, if applicable.

### PoC Implementation

1. Write a simple test case.
2. Use MCP to:
   - Provide dynamic test data.
   - Handle element locators adaptively.
   - Capture and send logs to an external reporting service.

### Execution & Observation

- Run the test across Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit.
- Compare execution results with and without MCP.

### Evaluation Criteria

- Ease of setup and integration.
- Test script readability and maintainability.
- Value addition compared to regular Playwright usage.

## 4. Risks & Challenges

- **Learning Curve:** MCP is relatively new with limited community support.
- **Setup:** Requires additional MCP server configuration.
- **Complexity:** Adds an extra layer of complexity with the protocol.
- **Overhead:** Additional complexity may not justify benefits for certain use cases.
- **Uncertain Script Suggestions:** AI-generated steps may not always be optimal.
- **Debugging Complexity:** Failures can be harder to trace due to AI-generated selectors or actions.
- **Overhead for Complex Pages:** Generated steps may be inefficient for very large or deeply nested pages.

## 5. Expected Outcomes

- A working demo of Playwright MCP test execution.
- Documentation of benefits and limitations.
